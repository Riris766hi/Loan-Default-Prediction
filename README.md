# Loan-Default-Prediction

Financial institutions such as Banks play a crucial role in market economies. 
For various reasons like buying a house or starting business, individuals and companies need access to loan or credit.
However,not every loan application can be approved.
To mitigate the impact of default risk, banks or other types of lender need to have strong prediction 
accuracy about how capable each applicant on repaying a loan.

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning model that can predict the probability of a loan will be default
or in the other words, how likely somebody will experience financial distress in repaying their loan.
In machine learning, this kind of problems is known as binary classification. 
So any machine learning method that can be used for binary classification problems can also be applied to this problems as well.
In this particular study, I will use three different machine learning methods and compare their performace. 
Those three methods are Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree. 

The dataset used for this project is obtained from the competition titled “Loan Default Prediction - Imperial College London” in kaggle.com. 
This data contains various parameters correspond to a set of financial transactions associated with individuals. 
The data are provided with over two hundred thousand observations and nearly 800 features.
